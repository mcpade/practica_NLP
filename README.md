# Práctica: Módulo NLP - Bootcamp KeepCoding - BIG DATA & MACHINE LEARNING

# NLP

In this practice, several Sentiment Analysis models are implemented and compared using Machine Learning algorithms and
Deep Learning architectures. In addition, the Topic Modeling technique is used for the analysis of Tweets and the Language technique
Modeling for the generation of Tweets.

The code is developed in Python.

Concepts covered in this practice:

- Libraries **numpy**, **pandas**, **re**, **spacy**, **Sklearn**, **Keras**, **gensim**, **pyLDAvis** by Python
- Data preprocessing: Use of regular expressions, lowercase conversion, removal of punctuation marks, Lemmas,
Stopword
- Models for Sentiment Analysis with Machine Learning algorithms. Pipeline for selection of the best parameters

      - Naive Bayes
      
      - SVM - Support Vector Machines

## Statement

1.- Machine Learning vs Deep Learning

1.1. Implementation of a Sentiment Analysis model with some Classic Machine Learning algorithm.

1.2. Implementation of a Sentiment Analysis model with some Deep Learning architecture.

1.3. Brief comparison of results. Confusion Matrix.

2.- Make Analysis of the tweets of the second dataset. What topics appear? How are these themes represented? What do they talk about?

3.- Choose one of the two presidents, and write tweets like them, using a Generative Model.

## Data set

For the first exercise the dataset **"train_sentiment.csv"** is used and for exercises 2 and 3 the datset **"dataset_2.json"** is used. Both are in the **data** folder of this repository
